/// pqEventDispatcher is responsible for taking each "event" from the test and
/// then "playing" it using the player. The dispatcher is the critical component
/// of this playback since it decides when it's time to dispatch the next
/// "event" from the test.
/// After an event is posted, there are two options:
/// \li the default option is to simply wait for a small amount of time before
/// processing the next event. The hope is that within that time any pending
/// requests such as timers, slots connected using Qt::QueuedConnection etc.
/// will be handled and all will work well. This however it fraught with
/// problems resulting is large number of random test failures especially in
/// large and complex applications such as ParaView. In such cases the better
/// option is the second option.
/// \li we only process already posted events (using a call to
/// QApplication::processEvents() and then rely on timers being registered using
/// registerTimer(). All these timers are explicitly timed-out, if active, before
/// processing the next event.
///
/// To enable the second mode simply set the eventPlaybackDelay to 0.
/// In either mode, all timers registered using registerTimer() will be
/// timed-out before dispatching next event.
///
/// To make it easier to register timers, one can directly use pqTimer instead
/// of QTimer.
