/// Event playback handler for a collection of miscellaneous commands.
/// For these events, the "object" on which the event is triggered is generally
/// immaterial.
///
/// Supported commands are:
/// \li \c pause : pause the application for a fixed time. Time is specified as
///                the arguments in milliseconds to pause the application for.
///                This is a sleep i.e. no events will be processed and the
///                application will appear frozen.
/// \li \c process_events: process pending events (including timers, etc.).
///                Optional time (in milliseconds) may be specified to also pause
///                the test playback. Unlike "pause" however, this will continue
///                to process all events arising in the application e.g.
///                responding to timer events.
